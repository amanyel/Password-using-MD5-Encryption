# Password-using-MD5-Encryption
PHP offers the md5 function which calculates the MD5 hash of a string using the MD5 Message Digest Algorithm. 
This algorithm takes a string and generates a 128-bit fingerprint of the input string.
MD5 is a one-way encryption which means that you cannot decipher the fingerprint to get the original string.
Yet another feature of MD5 is that the algorithm will always generate the same fingerprint for a given string.
 This simple project compose of two html pages and two PHP file and has a text(.txt) file for the storing the encrypted password.
